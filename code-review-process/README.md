# What is a good code review process?
A round table discussion with a collection of ideas what has worked well for people in the past

- Dedicated teams (code owners, supported by GitHub) for reviewing  
- GitHub action to send reminders for reviewers after 24 hours
	- Send messages to slack for reminding
- Small PRs 
	- Problem: PR chains
- Checklists (that create engagement and maybe some controversy.
- Standardized PR templates. Link bank to issue, etc.
- How to engage people to really review?
	- Have a "sparring partner" early, discussing architecture and the change
- "Review first" process (possibly supported/enforced by tools like Jira)
- What are the goals?
	- Quality assurance
		- Architecture
		- Security
		- Performance
		- Consistency
	- Knowledge sharing?
- Communicate what kind of review you need (manual test vs just code reading)
- Communicate what's expected of developers
- If errors appear in staging, who is responsible - author, reviewer, or both?
- Avoid blocking and drawn-out reviews
	- Approve with comment (with comment that outlines optional change request)
	- Checklist with definition of done in PR template. When all boxed are checked, you can approve, comments on the PR are for education and knowledge-sharing
	- Put optional changes in italics
	- Opinion or convention. Conventions should be documented / automated
	- [Netlify blog article on how to comment pull requests](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/05/feedback-ladders-how-we-encode-code-reviews-at-netlify/) - Dust, Pebble, Boulder. Standardized language
- Appreciative comments
- Communicate "negative" on a different channel before writing a comment 
- Don't be a "Seagull Reviewer" (flying in, make loud noises, shit on everything, fly away)
- Depreciating Humor in comments can be a problem if new people join who aren't in on the joke 
- Communicate the value of code reviews to the whole company to get support for doing them. Don't talk badly about reviews 
- Make review activity visible, to encourage people to do more
